# Skill: UI/UX Pro Max

- User flows should be as short as possible.
- Use visual hierarchy (bold headings, subtle secondary text).
- Feedback loops: every action should have a clear visual response (loading states, success toasts).
- Mobile-first: ensure all components work perfectly on touch screens.
- Dark mode support by default with curated HSL palettes.
